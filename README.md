# Spell-Checker
This program simulates how autocorrect on a phone would suggest words. 
The program requires a dictionary, which is provided as a text file.
The program will prompt you to type in a word. It will then suggest a list of words or none if the input word is too crazy. Press enter to quit or the program will keep asking you for an input.
Updated for Python 3.7.
